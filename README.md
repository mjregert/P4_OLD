Description

As a leader with the Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts of America, we’re always trying to find a good way to keep track of the various campsites that we’ve used and ones that are available for us as well as gather feedback about the facilities for future reference.  The project will be a campsite listing and review site where campsites can be added and removed, and review of the campsites can be submitted.  It will allow a user to look across campsites to find ones that meet their needs.  Future adds could include a reservation system.
